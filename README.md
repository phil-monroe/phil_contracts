# Phil Contracts

This repo is a playground to explore working with contract-first development using Google Protocol Buffers. The goal is to be able to describe contracts using simple protobuf message files and autogenerate packages that contain structs/data classes for various programming languages.

Languages that would be good to explore:
- [Ruby](./ruby/)
- Javascript (TBD)
- Typescript (TBD)
- Python (TBD)
